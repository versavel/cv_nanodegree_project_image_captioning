    "\n",
    "Begin by setting the following variables:\n",
    "- `batch_size` - the batch size of each training batch.  It is the number of image-caption pairs used to amend the model weights in each training step. \n",
    "- `vocab_threshold` - the minimum word count threshold.  Note that a larger threshold will result in a smaller vocabulary, whereas a smaller threshold will include rarer words and result in a larger vocabulary.  \n",
    "- `vocab_from_file` - a Boolean that decides whether to load the vocabulary from file. \n",
    "- `embed_size` - the dimensionality of the image and word embeddings.  \n",
    "- `hidden_size` - the number of features in the hidden state of the RNN decoder.  \n",
    "- `num_epochs` - the number of epochs to train the model.  We recommend that you set `num_epochs=3`, but feel free to increase or decrease this number as you wish.  [This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) trained a captioning model on a single state-of-the-art GPU for 3 days, but you'll soon see that you can get reasonable results in a matter of a few hours!  (_But of course, if you want your model to compete with current research, you will have to train for much longer._)\n",
    "- `save_every` - determines how often to save the model weights.  We recommend that you set `save_every=1`, to save the model weights after each epoch.  This way, after the `i`th epoch, the encoder and decoder weights will be saved in the `models/` folder as `encoder-i.pkl` and `decoder-i.pkl`, respectively.\n",
    "- `print_every` - determines how often to print the batch loss to the Jupyter notebook while training.  Note that you **will not** observe a monotonic decrease in the loss function while training - this is perfectly fine and completely expected!  You are encouraged to keep this at its default value of `100` to avoid clogging the notebook, but feel free to change it.\n",
    "- `log_file` - the name of the text file containing - for every step - how the loss and perplexity evolved during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not sure where to begin to set some of the values above, you can peruse [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) and [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf) for useful guidance!  **To avoid spending too long on this notebook**, you are encouraged to consult these suggested research papers to obtain a strong initial guess for which hyperparameters are likely to work best.  Then, train a single model, and proceed to the next notebook (**3_Inference.ipynb**).  If you are unhappy with your performance, you can return to this notebook to tweak the hyperparameters (and/or the architecture in **model.py**) and re-train your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Describe your CNN-RNN architecture in detail.  With this architecture in mind, how did you select the values of the variables in Task 1?  If you consulted a research paper detailing a successful implementation of an image captioning model, please provide the reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "The Image Captioning model is defined in the model.py file and consists of two parts, the Encoder and the Decoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the Encoder is to embed the visual features of the input image into a vector representation. Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are known to this well. So for the Encoder I use a pre-trained ResNet50 model and replace the last layer of the ResNet50 with a new fully connected linear layer. The pre-trained ResNet50 model, through its many convolutional layers, extracts the visual features of the image. The fully connected linear layer transforms the output of the ResNet convolutional layers into a vector representation. This vector is also referred to as the embedded vector. The size of the embedded vector in the paper [Show and Tell: A Neural Image Caption Generator\" by Oriol Vinyals, et al. (2015)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf) is 512 . Since my number of GPU hours was constrained, and I was fine producing a less performing model, I choose 300 for the size of embedding vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the Decoder is to transform the embedded vector into the image caption. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are made for this and for the Decoder architecture I chose the Long short-term memory (LSTM) network, followed by a dropout layer and a fully connected layer. The LSTM network is defined by the size of its input and its memory. The input size is equal the size of the embedded vector, 300 (see above). The memory size in the above mentioned paper is 512. I used 500. The paper does not mention how many layers they have in their LSTM. I chose to have 1 layer, since 2 or more would require much more GPU compution time to train the model. The purpose of the dropout layer is to avoid overfitting the model. I set the dropout probablity to 0.5, which is a typical value and seemed to work well. The purpose of the fully connected linear layer is to transform the output of the LSTM (size 500, see above) to a vector representing a word in the vocabulary (size 8855).\n",
    "\n",
    "### (Optional) Task #2\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we have provided a recommended image transform `transform_train` for pre-processing the training images, but you are welcome (and encouraged!) to modify it as you wish.  When modifying this transform, keep in mind that:\n",
    "- the images in the dataset have varying heights and widths, and \n",
    "- if using a pre-trained model, you must perform the corresponding appropriate normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the transform in `transform_train`?  If you left the transform at its provided value, why do you think that it is a good choice for your CNN architecture?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "Although I had the option to add additional image transforms, I left the transform as provided. Let me explain. \n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the transform is twofold:\n",
    "- The first objective of the image transform is to pre-process them so they can be used with the pre-trained ResNet50 model. This requires that the images are scaled to 224 by 224 pixels and normalized the same way as the ResNet50 model was trained. To achieve this purpose, no changes were required.\n",
    "- The second objective is to produce a trained model that generalizes, and does not overfit. For this objective, the provided transform randomly selects part of the image (\"cropping\") and randomly flips them horizontally. I could have added transforms to randomly rotate and modify the brightness of the images to further improve the odds of producing a model that generalizes well. Since the model was trained using only three epochs, adding these additional transforms to further randomize the training images would not have resulted in a better model. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #3\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you will specify a Python list containing the learnable parameters of the model.  For instance, if you decide to make all weights in the decoder trainable, but only want to train the weights in the embedding layer of the encoder, then you should set `params` to something like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "params = list(decoder.parameters()) + list(encoder.embed.parameters()) \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the trainable parameters of your architecture?  Why do you think this is a good choice?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "I wanted to train the parameters of the fuly connected layers in the Encoder and both the LSTM and fully connected layer in the Decoder. To do this, I used the following instruction:\n",
    "\n",
    "`params = list(encoder.embed.parameters()) + list(decoder.parameters())`\n",
    "\n",
    "Since I'm using the pre-trained ResNet50 model in the encoder, it's also worth noting that backpropagation is disabled for those layers using the `param.requires_grad_(False)` instruction in the model.py file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #4\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you will select an [optimizer](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/optim.html#torch.optim.Optimizer).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the optimizer used to train your model?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "I used the Adam optimizer, which is what the authors in the paper [Show, Attend and Tell: Neural Image CaptionGeneration with Visual Attention by Kelvin Xu et al (2016)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) used. No further experimentation with other optimizers was performed."

For now, we strongly encourage you to train your model for the suggested 3 epochs without worrying about performance; then, you should immediately transition to the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**) to see how your model performs on the test data.  If your model needs to be changed, you can come back to this notebook, amend hyperparameters (if necessary), and re-train the model.\n",

In the next (optional) step of this notebook, we provide some guidance for assessing the performance on the validation dataset."

    "To assess potential overfitting, one approach is to assess performance on a validation set.  If you decide to do this **optional** task, you are required to first complete all of the steps in the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**); as part of that notebook, you will write and test code (specifically, the `sample` method in the `DecoderRNN` class) that uses your RNN decoder to generate captions.  That code will prove incredibly useful here.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you decide to validate your model, please do not edit the data loader in **data_loader.py**.  Instead, create a new file named **data_loader_val.py** containing the code for obtaining the data loader for the validation data.  You can access:\n",
    "- the validation images at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/images/train2014/'`, and\n",
    "- the validation image caption annotation file at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/annotations/captions_val2014.json'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The suggested approach to validating your model involves creating a json file such as [this one](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi/blob/master/results/captions_val2014_fakecap_results.json) containing your model's predicted captions for the validation images.  Then, you can write your own script or use one that you [find online](https://github.com/tylin/coco-caption) to calculate the BLEU score of your model.  You can read more about the BLEU score, along with other evaluation metrics (such as TEOR and Cider) in section 4.1 of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf).  For more information about how to use the annotation file, check out the [website](http://cocodataset.org/#download) for the COCO dataset."
